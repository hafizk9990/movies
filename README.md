# Movies Project - MERN Stack
The project, movies reviewing site, is on the MERN stack. It uses bootstrap template (front-end), ExpressJS (middleware, static files and routing) NodeJS (server) and MongoDB (database). Moreover, a templating engine, Handlebars, has also been used

Remember, app.js is the entry point of the website

# Features
The web app offers several features. The movies are added by the admin, and you, as a user, can search those movies and leave your thoughts about them after signing in. If you want to leave remarks about a movie but it has not been added yet, you can log a request with the admins to add that movie, so that you can rate and review it later. Moreover, you can also like or dislike other people's thoughts and comments on the movie and, therefore, express yourself more openly

# Timeline
It took me over two months to learn the components of the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS, Handlebars) individually. Afterwards, it took me over a month to implement this project from scratch

Remember, I did not create the GUI. On the front-end, a template, FlixGo Movies, has been used. Modifications and customization were made to this template to ensure that it could be used properly to meet the requirements of the project and its use cases

# How to Run the Project?
You can download all the source code from here. It can be run locally on the port 64, 000 by running the following command: *nodejs app.js*. Afterwards, you can simply type this in your browser to run the project: *localhost:64000/home*
